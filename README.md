# Smartsight
A python based application that aids visually impaired individuals with basic navigation with the help of computer vision technology. It utilizes object detection along with other image processing techniques to provide helpful information about the environment.  

The program works by recording video (frames) from a camera and passing the frames to different modules to obtain the required results.

Object detection uses the **YOLOv8** model to detect object classes and provide bounding boxes.

The stereo vision module uses the Pytorch **MiDaS** model to generate disparity maps and calculate distances. 

The information provided by these modules are used by the audio feedback module to generate and play the suitable alerts.

The program consists of the following modules:  
- **Obj_detect_v8.py** is used for object detection.  
- **Stereo_CUDA.py** is used for depth estimation.  
- **Audio_feedback.py** is used for generating and playing audio alerts.  
- **Combined_video.py** acts as a central pipeline to integrate the aforementioned modules and run it as a whole.  
- ~~**Stereo_video.py** is used to generate disparity maps using a left and a right frame through a block-matching algorithm.~~ (deprecated)

This program also runs on a server-client architecture with server.py and client.py (tested on localhost).  
The program averages around 20 frames-per-second on a GTX 1080ti.
